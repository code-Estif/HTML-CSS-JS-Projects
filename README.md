# HTML CSS JS Projects

This repository is a collection of small projects I am building while learning frontend web development.  
The goal is to practice and improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by making real interactive pages.  

## Projects
1. Project 1 - FAQ Page: A simple and styled FAQ page explaining what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are.  
2. Project 2 - Color Flipper: A small page that changes background colors randomly on button click.  
3. Project 3 - Random Quote Generator: A page that shows random developer quotes using JavaScript arrays and functions.  

## About
I am learning frontend development from the basics. I started with HTML and CSS, then moved into JavaScript.  
Right now I have learned about loops, conditional statements, functions, and arrays with some methods.  
By making one project every week, I want to track my progress and apply what I learn step by step.
